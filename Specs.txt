Use Cases to Implement: 
----------------------
• addPlayerToDepthChart (position, player, position_depth)
	o Adds a player to the depth chart at a given position
	o Adding a player without a position_depth would add them to the end of the depth chart at that position
	o The added player would get priority. Anyone below that player in the depth chart would get moved down a
	position_depth 
• removePlayerFromDepthChart(position, player)
	o Removes a player from the depth chart for a given position and returns that player
	o An empty list should be returned if that player is not listed in the depth chart at that position
• getBackups (position, player)
	o For a given player and position, we want to see all players that are “Backups”, those with a lower position_depth
	o An empty list should be returned if the given player has no Backups
	o An empty list should be returned if the given player is not listed in the depth chart at that position
• getFullDepthChart()
	o Print out the full depth chart with every position on the team and every player within the Depth Chart
