Following assumptions were made.

1. As per example in the specs document, it was assumed players will be added in order. Hence no smarts added for sorting the players.
2. getBackups("QB", JaelonDarden) with Output = #10 – Scott Miller in specs has a position typo. To have that output the position should be "LWR"
3. removePlayerFromDepthChart(“WR”, MikeEvans) with Output = #13 – MikeEvans has a position typo. To have that outpout the position should be "LWR"
4. Assuming that different sports would have different rules for building Depth charts. IDepthChartService can be implemented by a class for each sports and instantiated by IDepthChartServiceFactory.
5. Not clean on the role of different teams affecting Depth charts. Let us discuss this in our review session.
